## 🚀 Example Usage:

**Before:** You had words but couldn't see them in the viewer
**Now:** You can see all 133+ words with full editing capabilities!

**Word List Display:**
```
  1. ✅ merhaba
  2. ✅ çawa yî?
  3. ⭕ tu çawa yî?
  4. ⭕ ez baş im
  5. ⭕ roj baş
  ... and 128 more words
```

**Search Example:**
- Type "çawa" → Shows only words containing "çawa"
- Select "Recorded" filter → Shows only ✅ words

## 💡 Pro Tips:

1. **Use Search**: When you have hundreds of words, use search to find specific ones quickly

2. **Filter by Status**: Use "Not Recorded" filter to see which words you still need to record

3. **Batch Delete**: Select multiple words at once for bulk deletion

4. **Regular Cleanup**: Periodically review and clean up your word list
